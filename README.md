# rc.lua - configuration for awesome WM

Please treat this repository as every other dotfile repo - take
inspiration and take what you need but don't fork because I don't
promise to not rewrite history.

## Features

* keyboard toggle win-e, win-d
* keyboard indicator (us, de)
* power supply indicator for newer ThinkPads
* hjkl bindings (may have been added in the meantime)

## TODO

* move the power supply indicator into its own repository and make it a
  library
